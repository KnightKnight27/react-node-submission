# React Node Test

## Fix login issues & implement Meeting REST API with optimizations

- **Resolved login issue** by setting up `REACT_BASE_URL` and configuring `env.development.local` in the client.
- **Ensured MongoDB** is running locally to support authentication.
- **Suggestion:** To avoid environment inconsistencies, consider Dockerizing the setup for streamlined deployment.

### Meeting API Implementation:
- Developed **RESTful APIs** for `Meeting` including:
  - `addMeeting`
  - `index` (list all meetings)
  - `view` (fetch a single meeting)
  - `delete`
  - `deleteMany`
  
### UI Fixes:
- Updated **API calls** in the frontend to match respective endpoints.
- Fixed **onSubmit handling** in `AddMeeting` component.
- Resolved **small UI bugs**, typos, and documentation inconsistencies.

### Additional Improvements:
- Added **safety checks** to API endpoints for better validation.
- Improved **code style and structure**, following best practices.
- Optimized **API integration** for better performance and maintainability.
